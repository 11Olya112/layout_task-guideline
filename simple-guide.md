# How to solve layout tasks 
1. Fork the repo and clone the forked one.
2. Run `npm install` (or just `npm i`)
3. Run `npm start`. (Open one more terminal window for the next steps)
4. Write you code in `index.html`, `style.css` inside `src` folder
5. Run `npm test` to check if you solved the task. (Fix all errors if any)
    - Run `npm run lint` if you don't see the diff in browser and fix code style errors.
    - Run `npm start` if reference is empty in browser diff.
6. Run `npm run deploy` to share your solution
